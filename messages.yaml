      Guess what? It's Friday!
      What will you not do today?
      Push to production.
  - tweet: |
      What do you call someone who realizes today is Friday and therefore holds off on pushing to production until next week?

      Smart. You call them smart. You can also call them by their name, I suppose.

      Happy Friday. Don't push to production.

        There's pushing to production on Friday.

        Then there's pushing to production on Friday the 13th.

        Don't do it.
